only allow it to work for currently visible forms, require a scroll down to continue

Do this stuff next:

.pyc gitignore not working?
typeerror on homepage in production
90 second bug
visual indicator for dictation mode and highlight targeted element
routing, get rid of /html/ and .html


--dropdown support

--visual indicator for dictation mode

--when extension is active, show indicator when page is finished loading and is ready for commands -- put (page loading) in input area

--somehow map chooses body as activeElement on google....maybe we should highlight the active element on dictation mode

--what happens if i'm in dictation mode and open a new tab manually? need to handle that case. Control.js tells background.js whenever it loads, and background.js sends a message to all tabs CHROME_DICTATION_STOP.
